<h1>Web Spider</h1>
<h2>Crawling the web..</h2>
<hr />
- This is a basic web spider for learning purpose, and for release something to opensource community.
<br />

<h1>How it Works</h1>
<h2>How is it done..</h2>
<hr />
- Also, it is very simple, and i'll try to maintain it simple. You introduce a start web (The first web to crawl at), it searches all the
urls in the indicated website and put them into an array. Then i'll check the sanity of the urls, also some basic regex stuff like 
(starts the url with http, ends with a TLD). This all in a while loop for recolecting hundreds of urls, but i implemented a easy system
to check the visited urls and not do repeated work.
<br />

<h1>Future features</h1>
<h2>Features i want to implement.</h2>
<hr />
- Search keywords in site.

- A long etc..
